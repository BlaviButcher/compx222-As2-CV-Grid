# CV and Grid assignment
Created a cv with 3 different styles:  
* Typewriter I kept pretty basic
* Zany I went over the top and it looks awful (which is the point of zany I
think)
* Professional - as it states  

Made a second html document styled using grid to make a gallery
## What I've learned
* CSS Grid
* How to serve files using a simple python HTTP server
