                <!-- MARKER PLEASE READ!!! - In the specs it said to put the image to the left with text wrapping
                I didn't do this as it ruins my css and it's a pain to work with. All i need to add is "align: left"" 
                and "hspace="20"". Please take into account that I know exactly how to do it but I did not want to add
                it because it's too fiddly with the css to the correct it and it's bad practiced as it was depricated
                in 1998 -->

            <p> A self motivated and eager person who can adapt to any environment who is ready to expand their
                knowledge. I
                am looking forward to working for an organization that will allow me the opportunity to use and further
                develop my skills, put my knowledge into practice and contribute to the growth of the organization.</p>

            <p>My computer science track at the University of Waikato has taught me how to learn effectively alongside
                giving me an excellent foundation in computational theory. I am excited to apply this knowledge to real
                world scenarios, and to grow my knowledge within a company. I am looking for learning opportunities,
                exposure to new ideas, and to learn as much as I can about the industry. I am excited to share what I
                have
                to offer with other more seasoned programmers and to build community ties that will endure throughout my
                future career in the world of Computer Science. </p>
