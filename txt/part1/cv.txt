Profile
A self motivated and eager person who can adapt to any environment who is ready to expand their knowledge. I am looking forward to working for an organization that will allow me the opportunity to use and further develop my skills, put my knowledge into practice and contribute to the growth of the organization.

My computer science track at the University of Waikato has taught me how to learn effectively alongside giving me an excellent foundation in computational theory. I am excited to apply this knowledge to real world scenarios, and to grow my knowledge within a company. I am looking for learning opportunities, exposure to new ideas, and to learn as much as I can about the industry. I am excited to share what I have to offer with other more seasoned programmers and to build community ties that will endure throughout my future career in the world of Computer Science.
